## Description

Video Demonstration: https://app.screencastify.com/v3/watch/dcvGIAMAlmPohaHAJLfC

The video demonstration above generates a ReadMe for a future project, not a real one.

This command-line tool was created in response to a boot camp assignment to apply skills learnt in JavaScript- particularly Node.js as well as the use of ES6 Syntax. String template literals and promissory functions are the main specific topics handled. The tool can be used to create a README that fulfils all the criteria of a good README, with sections for various categories of information a professional coder should include. It also includes the automated insertion of a license badge near to top of the file based on the user-selected license. This runs using the Iquirer npm package to ask the user for material, which is then formatted using a stringle template literal and creates a new file.

## Installation

This is a command line application which will be run on your machine. 

Copy this repository onto your local machine using `git clone` and the SSH key.

Install required node modules by running `npm install`.


## Usage
To use this tool, type `node index.js` on the command line. Then answer the questions as prompted. Once you have answered all the questions, you will receive a console message letting you know your new ReadMe has been created, titled with the name of your project as provided, with 'EasyReadme' appended.

## Credits

The source code for this project is taken from study materials from the bootcamp, and then edited to fulfill the learning objectives provided.
